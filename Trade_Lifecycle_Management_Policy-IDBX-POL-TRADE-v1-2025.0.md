- Manual and automated trading input
- All regions and market types (equity, FX, credit, derivatives)

---

## 3. Trade Lifecycle Stages

### 3.1 Pre-Trade

- Client validation, margin & KYC checks
- Venue selection and price discovery

### 3.2 Execution

- Fee and slippage calculation

### 3.3 Post-Trade
- Trade confirmation generation
- Settlement instruction routing
- Clearinghouse coordination (if applicable)
- Compliance validation and audit archiving

## 4. Regulatory & Audit Requirements

- All execution events must be logged and time-synchronized (UTC)
- MiFID II requires identification of trade initiator and AI involvement
- Audit trails must contain:
  - Trade ID, timestamps, counterparty, and execution logic
  - AI contribution metadata if applicable
- Reports must be exportable in RTS27/28-compatible format

---

## 5. Role of AIDANN

- May recommend or flag trade opportunities
- Final execution always subject to human or rule-based approval
- Output logged with `regulatory_tag: AI-Augmented`
- Confidence scores stored and reviewed quarterly for model oversight

---

## 6. Exception Handling

- Rejected trades must be tagged and logged with error codes
- Manual overrides must be attributed and confirmed by risk desk
- Any trade rollback must be matched with prior audit record

---

## 7. Settlement Controls

- Interfaces with custodian or CSD for instruction generation
- Fails are flagged and escalated with retry logic
- External matching discrepancies are reconciled with dual-confirmation

---

## 8. Oversight & Ownership

- The Trade Operations team owns lifecycle processes and escalation policies
- All changes to trade routing logic must be reviewed by the CSTO and Legal/Compliance
- Trading rules must be version-controlled and peer-reviewed

---

## 9. Review & Maintenance

- Policy is reviewed annually or following regulatory updates
- Changes must be logged and re-approved by the Trade Governance Board
