## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the global technical governance principles for the IDBX platform. It sets forth the standards, controls, and responsibilities required to ensure secure, scalable, and regulatory-compliant technology operations across the organization.

It is designed to ensure that all technology initiatives at IDBX—especially those involving AI systems, institutional integrations, and financial data processing—are aligned with industry best practices and our organizational mission.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All technology systems and platforms under IDBX control
- All global environments (production, development, staging, testing)
- All internal technical staff, third-party contractors, and data contributors
- All modules including AIDANN, the IDBX Trading Platform, MTF components, and APIs

## 3. Core Principles

- **Security-First Architecture**: All systems must be designed and operated with zero-trust principles, end-to-end encryption, and multi-factor authentication.

- **Compliance by Design**: The platform must natively support compliance with relevant regulations including MiFID II, GDPR, Basel III/IV, and the EU AI Act.

- **AI Transparency & Accountability**: All decisions made or influenced by AIDANN must be traceable, explainable, and auditable.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All infrastructure changes must be defined, reviewed, and deployed through version-controlled IaC practices.

- **DevSecOps Alignment**: Security testing and compliance checks must be integrated into all CI/CD pipelines with automated controls and rollback capabilities.

- **Zero Downtime**: The platform must be designed to support continuous availability through real-time failover, automated backup promotion, and hot-swappable components. All planned maintenance must be executed without service interruption.

- **Zero Exception**: Every system action must follow a defined procedure and generate a corresponding log entry, regardless of outcome. No process may silently fail or execute outside of traceable workflows. Logging must be structured, time-stamped, and tamper-evident.

- **Zero Trust**: The platform must operate under a Zero Trust architecture, where no system, user, or request is trusted by default—regardless of network origin. Every access must be verified with strict authentication, authorization, and context-based policies.

- **Zero Dependency**: All components must be independently deployable and platform-agnostic. The system must avoid hard-coded environment bindings and third-party lock-in, supporting modular deployment, abstraction, and fail-soft behavior.

## 4. Infrastructure Governance

- All environments must be logically and physically isolated using network segmentation and access controls.
- All infrastructure provisioning must use hardened images and follow minimum privilege principles.
- Geo-redundant architecture must be in place for all mission-critical services.
- System components must be monitored with automated alerting for thresholds including CPU, memory, latency, and failed transaction rates.

## 5. Data Governance

- Data must be classified as *public*, *internal*, *confidential*, or *restricted* and handled accordingly.
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit using FIPS-validated cryptography.
- Access controls must enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with justification-based privilege elevation.
- Data retention policies must meet or exceed a 7-year archival requirement for regulatory traceability.
- Anonymization procedures must be applied to any shared or non-production data sets.

## 6. Incident Response

- All incidents must follow the protocol defined in the IDBX Incident Response Plan (IDBX-PLAN-SEC-v1-2025.0).
- Incidents are classified by severity and response times are mandated as follows:
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 5 minutes
  - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 15 minutes
- Post-incident reviews must be conducted within 72 hours with full root cause analysis and mitigation reporting.

## 7. Policy Review and Oversight

- This policy will be reviewed bi-annually by the Global CSTO.
- All changes must be approved by the IDBX Technical Governance Council.
- Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary or contractual action and must be reported to the CSTO office immediately.

## 8. Enforcement and Exceptions

- All staff, contractors, and vendors are required to formally acknowledge this policy.
- Exceptions to any part of this policy must be documented, risk-assessed, and formally approved by the CSTO.
- Automated compliance enforcement (e.g., policy-as-code) must be implemented where technically feasible.
