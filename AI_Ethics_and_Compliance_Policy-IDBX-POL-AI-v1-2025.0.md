## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines IDBX’s commitment to ethical and lawful use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across its trading platform, infrastructure, and data-driven services. It ensures that AI systems reflect organizational values, respect human rights, and operate within global regulatory boundaries.

## 2. Guiding Ethical Principles

### 2.1 Fairness

- AI systems must avoid discrimination and be equally accessible to all users, regardless of geography, institution size, or demographic representation.
- Bias audits are mandatory for all models and datasets.

### 2.2 Transparency

- Every AI-generated decision or recommendation must be explainable to users and auditable by internal and external reviewers.
- Model summaries and decision rationales must be documented and available for review.

### 2.3 Accountability

- All AI decisions are attributable to named human owners within IDBX.
- Automated systems must include fallback or override mechanisms.

### 2.4 Safety & Security

- AI systems must not introduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
- Data used in AI must be encrypted, access-controlled, and anonymized where applicable.

### 2.5 Human-Centric Oversight

- Human judgment must remain the ultimate decision authority in critical processes such as trade execution, risk flags, and compliance alerts.

## 3. Regulatory Compliance

- **EU AI Act**: Classification and controls for high-risk AI are applied to all trading-impacting models.
- **GDPR & CCPA**: AI systems adhere to principles of data minimization, informed consent, and the right to explanation.
- **MiFID II**: All AI-generated market outputs used in trade must be logged and auditable.
- **FCA/SEC Guidance**: Human accountability, oversight, and model transparency are enforced.

## 4. Acceptable Use Policy for AI

- AI may be used for:
  - Trade strategy enhancement
  - Market risk prediction
  - Data distribution optimization
  - Client behavior analysis (non-personal)
- AI must **not** be used for:
  - Deceptive pricing or market manipulation
  - Profiling individuals based on sensitive attributes
  - Bypassing regulatory obligations or oversight

## 5. Data Ethics

- All training data must be obtained lawfully and ethically.
- No datasets containing personal, biometric, or sensitive political, religious, or health information may be used in model training.
- Internal anonymization checks are enforced before model ingestion.

---

## 6. Governance Responsibilities

- **AI Ethics Officer**: Appointed to oversee this policy and coordinate with legal, product, and development teams.
- **AI Oversight Committee**: Reviews compliance, monitors incident reports, and conducts ethics audits.

---

## 7. Incident Reporting & Remediation

- All suspected ethical violations must be reported to the AI Ethics Officer.
- Confirmed violations must be escalated to the Oversight Committee.
- Non-compliant AI systems must be disabled, audited, and either corrected or decommissioned.

---

## 8. Training & Culture

- All developers, data scientists, and decision-makers must receive annual AI ethics training.
- Ethics checklists and bias prevention check-ins are mandatory parts of model development workflows.
